        <p>一直对happens-before的理解有些模糊，看了网上的一些解读也是似懂非懂。怎么办？直接看看The Java® Language Specification中是如何解释的，准确、权威。</p>
<h3 id="17-4-5-Happens-before-Order"><a href="#17-4-5-Happens-before-Order" class="headerlink" title="17.4.5. Happens-before Order"></a>17.4.5. Happens-before Order</h3><p>Two actions can be ordered by a happens-before relationship. If one action happens-before another, then the first is visible to and ordered before the second.</p>
<p>If we have two actions x and y, we write <em>hb(x, y)</em> to indicate that x happens-before y.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If x and y are actions of the same thread and x comes before y in program order, then <em>hb(x, y)</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is a happens-before edge from the end of a constructor of an object to the start of a finalizer (§12.6) for that object.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If an action x synchronizes-with a following action y, then we also have <em>hb(x, y)</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If <em>hb(x, y)</em> and <em>hb(y, z)</em>, then <em>hb(x, z)</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The wait methods of class Object (§17.2.1) have lock and unlock actions associated with them; their happens-before relationships are defined by these associated actions.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the presence of a happens-before relationship between two actions does not necessarily imply that they have to take place in that order in an implementation. If the reordering produces results consistent with a legal execution, it is not illegal.<br>For example, the write of a default value to every field of an object constructed by a thread need not happen before the beginning of that thread, as long as no read ever observes that fact.  </p>
<p>More specifically, if two actions share a happens-before relationship, they do not necessarily have to appear to have happened in that order to any code with which they do not share a happens-before relationship. Writes in one thread that are in a data race with reads in another thread may, for example, appear to occur out of order to those reads.  </p>
<p>The happens-before relation defines when data races take place.  </p>
<p>A set of synchronization edges, S, is sufficient if it is the minimal set such that the transitive closure of S with the program order determines all of the happens-before edges in the execution. This set is unique.  </p>
<p>It follows from the above definitions that:</p>
<ul>
<li>An unlock on a monitor <em>happens-before</em> every subsequent lock on that monitor.</li>
<li>A write to a <em>volatile</em> field (§8.3.1.4) <em>happens-before</em> every subsequent read of that field.</li>
<li>A call to <em>start()</em> on a thread <em>happens-before</em> any actions in the started thread.</li>
<li>All actions in a thread <em>happen-before</em> any other thread successfully returns from a <em>join()</em> on that thread.</li>
<li>The default initialization of any object <em>happens-before</em> any other actions (other than default-writes) of a program.</li>
</ul>
